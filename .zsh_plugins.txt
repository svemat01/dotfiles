### Framework: zsh-utils
#
# zsh-utils is a micro-framework that is also well suited to pair with antidote. It
# provides much of the same core functionality from other bigger frameworks without the
# bloat or performance hit. Using zsh-utils, you may find you don't need much else.
# If you want a really thin framework, this is great.

# zsh-users/zsh-completions is a popular plugin for adding supplemental completions.
# We combine the `path:` and `kind:fpath` annotations here:

# Compinit plugins should be near the end of .zsh_plugins.txt so that $fpath has been
# fully populated. Use zsh-utils for its completion plugin.
